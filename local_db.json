While the field has been around since the mid-1960\u0026rsquo;s, its true potential is only now beginning to be fully exploited. \u003Cbb-note info=\u0027Many believe that recent advancements in parallel compute power (specifically GPUs), as well as the overwhelming amount of data that has been generated as a result of widespread internet access and usage, can help explain the recent success of Deep Learning.\u0027\u003E\u003C\/bb-note\u003E In the past 3 years specifically, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen a series of scientific breakthroughs in the use of Deep Learning \u0026mdash; a branch of Machine Learning that uses multiple stacked layers of processing units, often called artificial neural networks (ANN) \u003Cbb-note info=\u0027These units, to the disdain of many in the scientific community, are often referred to as neurons in an ANN. Deep Learning is loosely inspired by some of the cognitive processes that occur in the brains of humans and other animals. The analogy compares the information abstraction potential of processing units and weight multipliers in an ANN with the neurons and synapses in the brain of an animal. Many cognitive scientists reject this comparison because it represents an oversimplification of two disparate and poorly understood systems.\u0027\u003E\u003C\/bb-note\u003E, to form increasingly abstract representations of information and understanding. These neural networks are now solving problems that were expected to be decades away if solvable at all. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E \u003Cbb-p\u003E What makes this rise in Deep Learning so exciting is that it represents a shift away from rule-based programming, a tedious process whereby human programmers provide explicit instructions to be carried out by a machine, and instead towards a sort of general-purpose algorithm, the neural networks. Let that sink in for a second\u0026hellip; Traditionally, if a programmer wanted to implement a face detection algorithm for automatic shutter release built into the proprietary firmware of a digital camera, they would have to spend months researching state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection algorithms, or at least consult a specialist in the field. The programmer would then implement the formulas that they have learned through that process in code. If that same programmer were then asked to implement speech recognition for that same camera so that images could be captured via voice commands, they would need to repeat the tedious process of acquiring adequate understanding of proven algorithms in the domain of audio processing and computational linguistics. With Machine Learning, given enough quality example data, the same neural network algorithm, or at least a suite of similar network models, can be trained to solve both face detection and speech recognition problems. Moreover, the programmer need not know anything about applied research in either domain so long as they can train the neural network on enough photos with tagged faces and examples of people saying the desired voice command. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E \u003Cbb-quote\u003EWith Machine Learning, the same algorithm can be trained to solve both face detection and speech recognition problems.\u003C\/bb-quote\u003E \u003Cbb-p\u003E Through recent advancements in Deep Learning, machines are beginning to see, hear, and understand the world around them in ways and volumes that humans simply can\u0026rsquo;t.

For each MIDI song, midi-rnn filters out all non-monophonic tracks and discards them. It then breaks down the remaining tracks into a series of fixed-width windows that represent the song as sections of note events of 16th-note durations, including rests. Each window, \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E, contains \u003Ccode\u003En\u003C\/code\u003E such events where \u003Ccode\u003En\u003C\/code\u003E is the window size. The below image uses a window size of 10 (\u003Ccode\u003En = 10\u003C\/code\u003E). Each collection of events \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E is paired with the value of the event at \u003Ccode\u003En + 1\u003C\/code\u003E, which we call \u003Ccode\u003Ey\u003C\/code\u003E.

It symbolizes all (Western) musical notes C-2 - G8, as one of 128 values (0-127). In order to use this data as input to midi-rnn, we transform each note from this integer format into an encoding known as \u0026quot;one-hot\u0026quot; encoding before feeding it into our model for training. One-hot encoding represents categorical data as a binary representation with a \u0026quot;bit-depth\u0026quot; equal to the number of classes, in our case 129, where all bit values are set to zero except for the index of the category being represented by the encoding, which is set to one. Representing data in this way ensures that our model doesn\u0026rsquo;t mistakenly learn that the arbitrarily assigned magnitude of a MIDI note value carries meaning.

The training set is used to train our model, while the validation data is held out and used to evaluate our model\u0026rsquo;s performance on data that it has never seen before.\u003Cbb-note info=\u0022Many machine learning pipelines necessitate that the data is split into three groups: train\/validate\/test.

Instead, we simply see how well it performs at predicting the next note in each sequence from our validation set to better understand how well the model is learning to generalize the patterns that it is extracting from the training data. How much data you hold out for validation depends on the size and quality of your training data, but an 80%\/20% training\/validation is generally a good split to start with.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n \r\n \u003Cbb-p\u003E Our RNN is a network made up one input layer with \u003Ccode\u003Elength(X) * length(X1)\u003C\/code\u003E units (neurons), one or more hidden layers with an arbitrary number of units, and one output layer with \u003Ccode\u003Elength(X1)\u003C\/code\u003E units. \u003Ccode\u003Elength(X)\u003C\/code\u003E is the value of our window size (\u003Ccode\u003En\u003C\/code\u003E), say 10, which is the number of previous notes we will feed into our model at each timestep in order to predict the next note. \u003Ccode\u003Elength(X1)\u003C\/code\u003E is the number of categorical classes we are representing, or the \u0026quot;bit-depth\u0026quot; of our one-hot encoding, which is 129 in our case (0-127 + 1 for rest events).\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n \u003Cbb-p\u003E Our model is trained by iteratively feeding it input data \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E and computing the result of the output layer through a process of matrix multiplications, summations, and non-linear activation functions.\u003Cbb-note info=\u0022For brevity, we will not expound on this here.

Because we have a probability distribution as output, we can quantify how correct\/incorrect our model\u0026rsquo;s prediction is at each training step, and update our model to minimize our prediction error. In practice we feed our model batches of multiple \u003Ccode\u003EX, y\u003C\/code\u003E training pairs before updating it by backpropagating the sum of our error across the batch through the network.

We begin generation by feeding our model a single window \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E from an existing piece of music. This initial input is called the seed, or sometimes prime, and it is used to get our sequence generation process started.

Given a window size of 10, the first 9 notes now belong to our seed, and the most recent note was generated by our model. This \u0026lt;\u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E sequence is now fed back into the model for time step two, after which the first value in the input sequence \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E is removed and the predicted note is appended to \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E like last time. After 10 steps, our input sequence \u003Ccode\u003EX\u003C\/code\u003E is comprised entirely of note event categories generated by our model. The model can now run indefinitely using its own note event predictions as the input sequence to generate new melodies in this way.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n \r\n \u003Cbb-h2 id=\u0022using-midi-run\u0022\u003EUsing Midi-rnn\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n \r\n \u003Cbb-p\u003E You can use midi-rnn to generate your own new melodies!

Many players are involved, from router and device manufacturers to Internet Service Provider (ISP), Tier 1 networks, Internet Exchange Points (IXP), trans-oceanic fiber optic cables, and international standards committees. Lots of machines talking to machines and people talking to people. Surprising to some, most of the Internet is connected by fiber optics and copper cable. It\u2019s usually only the last stretch from your home router or a cell tower to your portable device that occurs over WiFi, a wireless radio frequency protocol that occupies the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands of electromagnetic spectrum (alongside other commercial devices like your microwave and garage door openers). It\u2019s this protocol that we focused on  particularly during the workshop. \r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-quote\u003E\r\n[WiFi] was introduced without the security considerations and requirements that are necessary over twenty years later, when everyone walks around with a wireless device on their person.\r\n\u003C\/bb-quote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe 802.11 WiFi standard was introduced in 1997, before anyone had a phone that could connect to the Internet. As such, the specification was introduced without the security considerations and requirements that are necessary over twenty years later, when everyone walks around with a wireless device on their person.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-media\u003E\r\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/e89d1194b6ecb7cb92f77bf1e27f763b\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/e89d1194b6ecb7cb92f77bf1e27f763b\u0022\u003E\r\n\u003C\/a\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv id=\u0022caption\u0022 style=\u0022margin-left: 0px;\u0022\u003E\r\nUnited States Electromagnetic Frequency Allocations\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/bb-media\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EProbe Requests and Beacon Frames\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nEver wonder how it is that your phone auto-connects to your home WiFi network automatically without you having to explicitly authenticate your device each time? This occurs through a series of network packet exchanges between your wireless device and your home router, or access point (AP). Specifically, it leverages the use of two related 802.11 packet types, probe requests sent from your device and beacon frames sent from your access point. Probe requests are small packets of information that are emitted from a wireless device when it isn\u2019t connected to an access point. They include two useful pieces of information, 1) the SSID, or network name, of the access point it has previously connected to and 2) the MAC address of the probing device, a unique identifier that can be used as a device fingerprint. Many devices that have WiFi enabled, but aren\u2019t connected to a network, are constantly emitting probe requests hoping that their router will hear them and initialize an auto-connection. That\u2019s useful if you happen to have just entered your home from work, but as we will see, it\u2019s also identifiable information that\u2019s openly projected from your device when you are out and about, nowhere near the router your device is attempting to connect to. In this way, WiFi devices are often constantly advertising your personal network history wherever you go, leaving a fingerprint in the WiFi radio ether for others to pick up and use.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nBeacon frames serve a similar purpose to probe requests in that they exist to facilitate the authentication of devices to access points. Beacon frames contain the same useful bits of information as probes, only they are sent from access points that are advertising their existence to nearby devices. As soon as your phone sees a beacon frame emitted from the \u201cMy Home WiFi\u201d access point, it will initialize a connection to the router. While this is helpful in the genuine case where your device auto connects to a known network, it also makes it trivial for an attacker to force a connection from your device to a malicious network by simply naming their network the same as your home network. This makes probe requests and beacon frames a lethal combination. One advertises the name of previously connected networks at all times, while the other can be used to auto-connect devices knowing only the names of previously connected networks.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EAccessing Network Data\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nNow that you\u2019ve learned that the network devices around you regularly broadcast probe requests, you might be wondering how you would go about accessing that data. You\u2019re privy to seeing a list of network names on your phone or laptop (populated by the beacon frames) when you are looking to connect to a new network, but you likely haven\u2019t ever been able to access the other packets of data hidden from normal view. You can\u2019t see activity from other people\u2019s devices using that familiar network drop down and you certainly can\u2019t get list of other people\u2019s connection histories. Instead, your operating system filters out this data, exposing only the information necessary for you to connect to a WiFi network.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWell, it turns out that many consumer WiFi cards support a special behavior called monitor mode that effectively removes this filter. Monitor mode allows your computer to passively eavesdrop on the unencrypted radio packets broadcasted nearby independent of the intended sender and receiver. Unlike a wired connection, wireless broadcast can\u2019t be easily directed to a single device. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, messages are broadly cast to all devices.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.aircrack-ng.org\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EAircrack-ng\u003C\/a\u003E is a standard suite of networking tools that allow you to inspect and interface with WiFi data in this unfiltered manner.

MAC addresses are unique numbers assigned to a network interface by the manufacturer. They act as a sort of device fingerprint which can be used to identify the device, and in the case when you can tie a MAC address to the device owner, the presence of nearby human. Information about the manufacturer of the device is also embedded in a portion of the MAC address, making it trivial to identify if it belongs to an Apple iPhone or a Samsung Android phone. Other indicators can also be derived from intercepted packets, like signal strength and timestamps. When monitoring WiFi traffic, it\u2019s not unlikely that packets with a strong signal strength are close by. Those loudly broadcast packets you keep receiving from an Apple device might just be coming from that fellow sitting next to you who is robotically thumbing through his iPhone.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOnce you\u2019ve identified which devices belong to which humans you can start to gather more information about their owners. By collecting and grouping probe requests and cross referencing their network names with other datasets, some of which are publicly available, you can begin to draw conclusions about where the device owner may live, work, and play.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EWar Driving and Geographic Network Datasets\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWar driving is the process of geo-tagging beacon frames from wireless access points in an attempt to understand where in the world they are physically located. By collecting data in this fashion, large datasets can be amassed and used to identify where the networks a device is probing for exist in the real world. In fact, Google street view cars have been \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2012\/05\/google-wifi-fcc-investigation\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ereported\u003C\/a\u003E to be constantly war driving, creating collection of geo-tagged networks to use in their location services.

Within a single week Renew was able to track 4 million devices throughout the city by placing sensors in public trash cans. It\u2019s difficult to discern how many institutions deploy such tracking techniques as the act of listening to probe requests is \u201cpassive\u201d and can not be detected, but given the interest in such data and the fact that such tools are readily available we suspect it\u2019s very common.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EHoneypot \u0026 Evil Twin Networks\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nIn addition to the mass data collection and tracking mentioned above, probe requests can also be exploited to execute more malicious network attacks. Because networks are often configured to auto-connect to known networks, an attacker can easily create ad-hoc networks with SSIDs that match those a targeted device is probing for. By forcing a connection in this way an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in software running on the device to record, intercept, or alter the user\u2019s Internet activity, or perform a phishing attack to steal the user\u2019s account credentials.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nInternet service providers have been known to exploit this SSID auto-connection feature in the wild. Comcast\u2019s XFINITY routers automatically create two networks, one to serve the customer who purchased the router, and the second to serve the rest of their customers. This second network beacons with the SSID \u201cxfinitywifi\u201d to lure probing customers to auto-connect. This prompts a captive portal on the user\u2019s device with a form to login to their Comcast account and piggy back of the router owner\u2019s Internet connection to surf the net.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EWhat\u2019s to Be Done?\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe picture we paint of the WiFi protocol is fairly bleak. The aging WiFi standard was introduced at a time when the networked landscape was very different than it is now, and yet we continue to expect it to \u201csecurely\u201d connect the devices we rely so heavily on today. Though probe requests and beacon frames likely aren\u2019t going anywhere soon, there are a few measures that can be taken to protect yourself from data collection and targeted attacks against your devices. The most effective protection is to turn your device\u2019s WiFi off while in-transit or whenever you aren\u2019t connected to a familiar network. Doing so will keep your device from constantly sending probe requests and make it inaccessible to attackers.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-quote\u003E\r\nThe most effective protection is to turn your device\u2019s WiFi off while in-transit or whenever you aren\u2019t connected to a familiar network.\r\n\u003C\/bb-quote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nAnother privacy mechanism that is starting to be more regularly adopted by device manufacturers and operating system developers is MAC randomization. This approach broadcasts probe requests with a random MAC address, making it difficult to detect the presence of an identifiable MAC fingerprint or to tie multiple probed SSIDs to the same device. More devices are using this method today than we found them to be two years ago, but this approach still \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/papers.mathyvanhoef.com\/asiaccs2016.pdf\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eisn\u2019t without its shortcomings\u003C\/a\u003E.

You\u2019ll need partners that you can lean on for advice not only when you\u2019re trying to rollout technical features, but also for when you need creative problem solving for how to improve UX, optimize user flows, reduce infrastructure costs, etc. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nFor this to happen you need to communicate with your partners and talk about your short, medium, and long term goals. This not only helps with buy-in but also minimizes wasted time due to short term planning and development that doesn\u2019t fall inline with long term goals. Not to mention that it helps partners better understand business decisions made along the way that could otherwise cause \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business-IT_alignment\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ealignment issues\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nDistilling your Core Value Proposition\r\n\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOne thing that we\u2019ve seen time and time again are startups approaching us with a great idea, then getting lost in the bells and whistles. The concept of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) should always be in the forefront of startup\u2019s collective minds. We\u2019re big believers in the idea of focusing on a core feature-set that will allow your startup to stand apart from the competition. Then after that space is won, start adding features based on learnings. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThis is important for several reasons, not least of which is the fact that all startups have a limited runway. The proof of concept has to be developed as soon as possible and as lean as possible. Not only so you can quickly position yourself for additional funding, but also because many features added at early stages are based on our best guesses, our gut feelings, and often times they can be off or flat out wrong. This ends up leading to lost time and money that could have gone towards something much more valuable.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nInstagram launched in 2010 and made it easier than flickr or facebook to take photos, add filters and post.

After launch you move to Measure, then Learn and end up at Build again as you enter your 2nd iteration and so on into infinity. The idea is that you are always taking your learnings and improving on the product as you go.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nManaging the Work with Iterative Development \u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWe\u2019re not dogmatic about SCRUM, but we do think it\u2019s a great tool. Besides the general benefit of instilling a procedural discipline to your development process, there are a few simple benefits that to us, sell the point:\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nIterative Sprints\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-media\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/937258d28e68fe0d08f284e212b1cc95\u0022 style=\u0022margin-top:-30px;\u0022 \u003E\u003C\/bb-media\u003E\r\nIterative Sprints are incredibly helpful in that they force the development team into two week (normally) planning of deliverables.  Features are broken up and prioritized in order to have a \u201cusable\u201d product at the end of every sprint. This way features can be used, learned from, and improved upon throughout development.  Before SCRUM we would work on completing an entire module then have to go back and make changes after the fact as we noticed usability issues.\r\n\r\n \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003EEpics, Stories and Tasks\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe breaking up functionality into epics, stories and tasks not only guides the team into thinking through every element of the work that has to go into a feature but also allows for easier, more accurate estimating of these features. It feels like a lot of work up front but in the end it provides a much clearer path, and saves time.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nMinimum Viable Product\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-quote credit=\u0022Eric Ries\u0022\u003E\r\n\u201cthe minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.\u201d\u003C\/bb-quote\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe focus on prioritizing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is perfectly inline with the needs of the startup. As mentioned earlier, it\u2019s impossible to do everything correctly on first attempt. Focusing on an MVP lets you learn from the product as you are developing it in order to increase the chances of having the best possible feature by the time you finish.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003EOther Benefits\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nIn this section we\u2019ve focused some of the main benefits of SCRUM that are, in our opinion, irrefutable benefits to the average startup. However, there are many other concepts\/tools in the SCRUM framework that are of great benefit: Daily standups, Sprint reviews and retrospectives, Product and Sprint Backlogs, the concept of Product Owners, the definition of Done. If you\u2019re not already using SCRUM we encourage looking into it. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.scrumguides.org\/docs\/scrumguide\/v2017\/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 \u003EFor more information\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nA Healthy Code Base\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nAllowing Time for Refactoring\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe pressure to push out a complete platform often results in \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.techopedia.com\/definition\/27913\/technical-debt\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecode debt\u003C\/a\u003E. This is completely normal. Speed is prioritized over proper system design and structuring. It is extremely important to allow for \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Code_refactoring\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecode refactoring\u003C\/a\u003E. This is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior, in order to reduce complexity, improve readability, and improve source code maintainability and extensibility. It\u2019s easy to dismiss this as abstract technical theory but its consequences are very real and could cost much time and money in the not-so-distant future when you\u2019re trying to modify your platform. Just like a building, a platform is only as strong as its foundation. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThis idea is also important during the lifetime of a platform. There is a concept called Software Entropy\u003Cbb-note info=\u0022Jacobson, Ivar; Christerson, Magnus; Jonsson, Patrik; \u00d6vergaard, Gunnar (1992), Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach, ACM Press. Addison\u2013Wesley, pp. 69\u201370, ISBN 0-201-54435-0  ,a href=\u0027https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_entropy\u0027 target=\u0027_blank\u0027\u003Ewiki\u003C\/a\u003E\u0022\u003E\u003C\/bb-note\u003E, which states that as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. With every change and modification, if active measures (code refactoring) are not taken to correct this issue, you\u2019ll end up with what we affectionately refer to as \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spaghetti_code\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ESpaghetti Code\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nI also want to quickly mention testing. It deserves an entire blog post but for now I\u2019ll leave you with a few things you should dig a little deeper into. If you get anything from this post you should realize that a platform is constantly changing and evolving. Throughout the process of refactoring (as well as throughout the Build-Measure-Learn cycle) you should create test plans to help organize your testing. A Critical Test plan, for example, defines scope, approach, resources and schedule of test activities and can help you organize your regression testing. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nChoosing the Right Technology\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nDevelopment languages and frameworks are tricky. Everywhere you look you\u2019ll find another article or blog post talking about what the next big thing is and what\u2019s on its way out.  You\u2019re going to find fanatics and haters on all sides of this topic. The truth is that you\u2019ll have to consider the Pros and Cons of your specifics. Many times it comes down to what the development team is most comfortable with. Beware trends and be aware of the trajectory of any language\/framework you select. You want it to be a mature framework, feature rich, and have an active community. In regards to databases, you have to consider whether a relational or non-relational database makes most sense and based on that, select the best fit. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOpen Source is our preference and makes sense for most startups. Although you should always be aware of the licensing details of your selected open source tools. Just because something is open source doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re given the right to use it as you wish.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nVersion Control\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWhen you own an online startup, all you own besides leased infrastructure and your \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/g\/goodwill.asp\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Egoodwill\u003C\/a\u003E (hopefully) is your source code. It\u2019s important that you maintain it carefully. How do you do that? Use a source code repository. GitHub, Bitbucket, LaunchPad, SourceForge, GitLab, take your pick. The important thing is that you are able to maintain your code on the cloud, easily share and collaborate between multiple team members, review code, identify and fix conflicts, and track the state of your code at any point in time. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nDocumentation\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nDocumentation is another important and often overlooked part of software development. It helps keep track of the latest state of the code, allows for easier maintenance and knowledge transfer. Additionally, documentation is often required by investors as part of their \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.itduediligenceguide.com\/it-due-diligence-source-code-review\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Edue diligence\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nDocumentation doesn\u2019t have to be as difficult as you might imagine. There are many tools that help create quick documentation from source comments. Besides this type of in-code documentation though, you should document process flows. This goes a long way to shorten the learning curve for new dev team members.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nPreparing for Scalability\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nA platform is not either scalable or non-scalable. There are many components of a system that can create a bottleneck and cause a system to not scale properly under different circumstances.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nComplex queries, data classification algorithm processing times, data refinement processing times, etc  There\u2019s a lot to be considered but here are a few precautions that should be taken in order to deal with certain bottle necks:\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EDatabase clustering\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELoad balancing web servers\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ECaching content\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ERapid Server provisioning (more about this below)\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EAutoscaling \u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\nWhen appropriate, consider the possibility of using existing infrastructures vs the need for building an infrastructure. For example, serving videos from you server vs using youtube. This would of course depend on the service you\u2019re providing and whether the infrastructure in question is providing part of the core value or a secondary value.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nCloud Based Development\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nJust 10 years ago preparing for infrastructure growth or rapid scaling was a time consuming and expensive undertaking. New servers, routers, load balancers, etc, would have to be procured in anticipation of growth or traffic spikes. Today with services like AWS, that\u2019s not the case. The same server procurement can be done in hours, and if planned for correctly, in minutes.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nDue to incremental billing models cloud computing services like AWS allow you to put spin servers up and down at peak hours, or during spikes while billing you for only the minutes used. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nBesides the incredible scalability benefit and flexibility, cloud computing allows for faster and less expensive disaster recovery and increased security. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nSecurity and Threat Modeling\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWhat do Under Armour, FedEx, Uber, Pizza Hut, Deloitte and Equifax have in common?

You have to make sure to keep up with the ever changing landscape. For example, if your startup has an international user base does it comply with \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EGDPR\u003C\/a\u003E (which becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018)?\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nDealing with Human Resource Constraints\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nWhen building, its important to make a realistic assessment of the sustainability of certain tasks based on Human Resources constraints. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nCustomer support platforms, manual curation, data classification, and blog post creation are a few example of the sort of thing that require constant upkeep. Some of these things can be handled with technology: Chatbots to help take some of the load off of support, crowd-sourcing for certain types of curation, ML (Machine Learning) for data classification. But some things still need humans (\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/603465\/the-relentless-pace-of-automation\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Efor the time being\u003C\/a\u003E). \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nIt\u2019s arguably better not to have a feature than to have one that can\u2019t be maintained and risks the erosion of user trust.\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022width:50%; float:left;height:100px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbb-h3\u003EPart 1:\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/brangerbriz.com\/blog\/lessons-learned-over-two-decades-of-developing-startups\u0022\u003E\u003C Introduction\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022width:50%; float:right;  text-align:right;height:100px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbb-h3\u003EPart 3: \u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/brangerbriz.com\/blog\/lessons-learned-over-two-decades-of-developing-startups-measure-part3\u0022\u003EMeasure \u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n","id":40,"name":"Description"},{"value":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/branger_briz\/status\/989164002348535809","id":169,"name":"Tweet Link"}]},{"name":"Blog List","type":4,"id":75,"data":[{"value":"[\u0022startups\u0022]","id":177,"name":"Tags"},{"value":"\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/0d6052d5b67ed4cf043752f110f3e66e","id":170,"name":"Social Media Thumbnail"},{"value":"lessons-learned-over-two-decades-of-developing-startups-measure-part3","id":43,"name":"slug"},{"value":"Developing Startups Part 3: Measure","id":33,"name":"Post Title"},{"value":"by Paul Briz","id":41,"name":"written by"},{"value":"1","id":34,"name":"Published"},{"value":"04\/19\/2018","id":35,"name":"Create on"},{"value":"04\/19\/2018","id":37,"name":"Post Start"},{"value":"","id":38,"name":"Post End"},{"value":"Part 3 of a 4 part series \u201cLessons Learned Over Two Decades of Developing Startups\u201d.

With these goals in mind you can set up funnels in Google Analytics to help visualize your user flow. This helps find drop off points along the funnel that can tell you where users exit desired path. Now that you can pinpoint problem areas you can start start planning solutions.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECohort Analysis\u003C\/b\u003E - A cohort is a segment (group) of users based on a date. For example, if you\u2019re looking at acquisition date cohorts by user retention, your analysing the user retention of users acquired on a certain date. Acquisition date cohorts by revenue per user means you\u2019re looking at how much revenue was created over a period of time by a group of users acquired on a certain date. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/cutroni.com\/blog\/2015\/02\/06\/using-cohort-report\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EHere\u2019s a good post\u003C\/a\u003E that helps you understand Google Analytics cohort report. \u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003E\r\nSplit (or A\/B) Testing \u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThis is a great tool for gathering information on user preferred functionality.

If you do need convincing, \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.startups.co\/articles\/defining-target-market-think-small\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eread this\u003C\/a\u003E. Defining your target audience, like with everything else, starts with a gut feeling, then moves to research, exercises like \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.inc.com\/molly-reynolds\/how-to-create-customer-personas-that-brealife-into-your-marketing.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecreating customer personas\u003C\/a\u003E, defining your \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.powerreviews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Path-to-Purchase-Whitepaper061716.pdf\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Econsumer journeys\u003C\/a\u003E, then conversations, interviews, polls, etc. However you do it, don\u2019t skip over this process. It provides focus, sharpens your UX\/UI, and provides a frame of reference by which you can qualify your decisions and get your investors and team on board. On the flipside, not understanding your users habits, likes and culture, you stand to lose a lot of time and money creating features and ultimately a product, they won\u2019t use.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOnce the platform is launched is when the real work starts. Many times a platform is created with one target in mind only to find out that they missed the mark. This could happen even if you had your target figured out perfectly. The market changes so quickly that user habits can change in a matter of months. But this doesn\u2019t have to be a problem as long as you stay on top of current trends and you learn from your users and adjust accordingly. You\u2019re platform is your best tool for doing this.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nUser Feedback\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOnce you\u2019ve launched, the simplest way to get the insights into your users is to ask them. Feedback forms and reviews should be built into the platform as a sincere effort to learn from your users. Yes it\u2019s scary to open the doors to direct criticism, but if you\u2019re not willing to receive and process your startup\u2019s faults, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h3\u003E\r\nSupport Ticketing Platforms\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe next step in your evolution through Zen and the art of platform maintenance is the implementation of a customer support platform. This steps up your game, letting your users know that not only are you listening but that you\u2019re acting on their concerns. And if done correctly it also lets you start building a knowledge base which can allow future support seekers to looks through previous user\u2019s concerns and questions.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if you\u2019re going to take this approach you must have the (human) resources in place to review and do triage. You don\u2019t want requests falling into the black hole of customer service, but you also don\u2019t want all your requests to pass unfiltered to the dev team. Your support team should let users know that they are being attended to while also protecting the development team from an onslaught of requests. A properly setup support process can result in a more loyal user base.  It\u2019s a powerful tool. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThere are many 3rd party services that can be incorporated into your support flow without having to invest in building your own system. Zendesk, Freshdesk, Zoho desk, and HappyFox are a few.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-h2\u003EValidated Learning\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThis Build-Measure-Learn cycle is the process by which Validated Learning occurs. Validated Learning is exactly what it sounds like, learning that has been validated by data. The Lean Startup methodology specifically emphasizes frequent experiments on actual users to generate the data and validate your hypothesis. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\nThe \u003Ci\u003ELearn\u003C\/i\u003E phase of the cycle is where you take your data, feedback and learnings and generate ideas and new hypotheses in order to \u003Ci\u003Ebuild\u003C\/i\u003E or modify (experimental) functionality and begin the process over again.\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022width:50%; float:left;height:100px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbb-h3\u003EPart 3:\u003C\/bb-h3\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/brangerbriz.com\/blog\/lessons-learned-over-two-decades-of-developing-startups-measure-part3\u0022\u003E\u003C Measure\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022width:50%; float:right;  text-align:right;height:100px;\u0022\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/bb-p\u003E","id":40,"name":"Description"},{"value":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/branger_briz\/status\/989164002348535809","id":169,"name":"Tweet Link"}]}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":7,"data":[],"child_component":[{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":20,"data":[{"value":"Web Site","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":22,"data":[{"value":"Experiential","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":19,"data":[{"value":"Interactive","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":21,"data":[{"value":"Mobile","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":25,"data":[{"value":"CMS","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":18,"data":[{"value":"Generative","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":23,"data":[{"value":"WebGL","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":27,"data":[{"value":"Machine Learning","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"\u003Cp\u003Ethis is an example of what ML info looks like\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]},{"name":"Featured Tag List","type":7,"id":79,"data":[{"value":"Blockchain","id":51,"name":"Tag"},{"value":"","id":472,"name":"Tag description"}]}]},{"name":"Portfolio List","type":4,"id":2,"data":[],"child_component":[{"name":"Portfolio List","type":4,"id":29,"data":[{"value":"\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/c46c7d72f703369cafa74fffe59b322b","id":171,"name":"Social Media Thumbnail"},{"value":"\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/3d76dcfa3630b2011e3d6c3bfa37bac6","id":16,"name":"Header Image"},{"value":"sportsmanias","id":48,"name":"slug"},{"value":"Case Study","id":17,"name":"Post Type"},{"value":"SportsManias","id":8,"name":"Post Title"},{"value":"sports news startup platform","id":46,"name":"Post Sub Title"},{"value":" 2012 - current","id":20,"name":"year"},{"value":" http:\/\/sportsmanias.com\/","id":21,"name":"url"},{"value":" Web Dev, iOS + Android Dev,Design\/UX consultation, Infrastructure design + dev + maintenance","id":22,"name":"services"},{"value":" CLIO Short List 2017, Gold Addy Award (District)","id":23,"name":"recognition"},{"value":"2-3 million monthly views","id":24,"name":"results"},{"value":"","id":47,"name":"clients"},{"value":"1","id":9,"name":"Published"},{"value":"1","id":45,"name":"Feature on Home"},{"value":"06\/25\/2017","id":10,"name":"Created on"},{"value":"","id":12,"name":"Post Start"},{"value":"","id":13,"name":"Post End"},{"value":"SportsManias is a sports news aggregation platform that consists of multiple fronts including native iOS and Android mobile apps, an iOS animated emoji keyboard, and a desktop website.\r\n","id":14,"name":"Summary"},{"value":"\u003Cbb-p\u003E SportsManias is a sports news aggregation platform that consists of multiple fronts including native iOS and Android mobile apps, an iOS animated emoji keyboard, and a desktop website. \u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\u003Cbb-p\u003E Back in 2011 SportsManias came to us with an idea.

This allows for the site to maintain only the minimum necessary server resources in order to handle sudden peaks while not breaking the bank during low traffic periods. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Csection class=\u0022media\u0022 style=\u0022width: 550px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/ee56dce93434cfca70bf7e5643ebbba0\u0022\u003E\u003C\/section\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDistributed Processing \u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to reduce system wide latency, processes are queued across different workers and run in parallel. \r\n\u003C\/p\u003E","id":473,"name":"Post Content v2"}]},{"name":"Portfolio List","type":4,"id":30,"data":[{"value":"\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/cdb74c531a8759af632aa6e6202f581b","id":171,"name":"Social Media Thumbnail"},{"value":"","id":16,"name":"Header Image"},{"value":"nike_cap_customizer","id":48,"name":"slug"},{"value":"Case Study","id":17,"name":"Post Type"},{"value":"Nike Cap Customizer","id":8,"name":"Post Title"},{"value":"3D product customizer","id":46,"name":"Post Sub Title"},{"value":" 2016 - current","id":20,"name":"year"},{"value":" http:\/\/nike.teamheadwear.com","id":21,"name":"url"},{"value":" Web Dev, Design\/UX consultation, 3D modeling, Maintenance","id":22,"name":"services"},{"value":" Silver Addy Award","id":23,"name":"recognition"},{"value":"","id":24,"name":"results"},{"value":" Paramount Apparel","id":47,"name":"clients"},{"value":"1","id":9,"name":"Published"},{"value":"0","id":45,"name":"Feature on Home"},{"value":"06\/25\/2017","id":10,"name":"Created on"},{"value":"","id":12,"name":"Post Start"},{"value":"","id":13,"name":"Post End"},{"value":"The Cap Customizer on Nike Team HeadWear allows you to create and order your own custom caps without leaving anything to your imagination.\r\n","id":14,"name":"Summary"},{"value":"\u003Cbb-p\u003EThe Cap Customizer on Nike Team HeadWear allows you to create and order your own custom caps without leaving anything to your imagination.

The Editor also features snippets of code (small building blocks) you can copy+paste into your scene to get going quicker.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n \t\t\t\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ciframe noborder=\u0022\u0022 style=\u0022width:100%;padding:0\u0022 src=\u0022\/\/threejsplaygnd.brangerbriz.com\/editor\/#B\/pVVtb9s2EP6s\/Ipr9qFyq1BqsA6d4wRonTQpsGJBksLYp4GWzhZTSdRIKo4d+L\/vSFGynRcU3QS\/nI53z70f94IgGL06\/XN889flGeSmLE72LGuLQp45KhiVaDikOVcazfF+Y2YHH\/b9kTbLAls6mMpsCQ8tHUx5+n2uZFNlB6kspBrCLzP3HHmBkqu5qIaQdAx5h2pWyMUQcpFlWHn+ujUUbyyN4t63kbV5sud9SZWoDWiVHu\/H8VTxao5qqsSKpbKMCz7VsckV4q3+uy748rzK4lvPYqWo2K3ePyE7DuXk\/0CeosHUSPUyonc5EDMI4RX0CguczgsYbBg8y87RTHB6\/sdX1JrPMRwceeU7riDlJSoegU6xwggUVhkqVEcbiTlKqp9aRlByg0rwgijUeYcya6rUCFkBFbepwwFV0BfEak\/gGBaiyuSCiapCNRGZySO4eMS+QDHPTVfJzgsSqnABNxdXZ2fMxXDlT0J4gFqhRnWHp4oT1PxTM5shtYlRDcIaBo\/BGG+MHBfI1dj2E2HPeKHxiRiFcS1WGMLEutnDZDJtSqwMsx3DeF2T\/DgXRRb2SWOZLM8KtFLQJzloM7wTyiUqXVN9xB2O3WkI75MIJvFFBO\/ok9CzsdwCsFpqYfPMVoT1Pkl6A650O\/jXluPq7EVmFG8Ith6CBJMj+htZM5Z4+xYG\/dTRVNUk0cJ8KaldvhlRaFZInt3gvWkUhq8Zi01Lr2Itm5rd1vPXvbtB1zA7Lo2XhbBZOveHIVl3kUZw+Nvv7N1h5FJgv64sG7iu63bgqJfzT1yL9Ks\/DR90zjNqg6GX+Fxwc92yIvAbJLlvV4ht5Xpof9ZbdgjyiY3wafdve1azheL1Nal19E2fvSuskZsJ8WryYUdJuSPbaaGrN+x6sSn1PaFRhDmjxUHNRcP1xnUHHLQd8KzS8r8orX5CSUnDX3TvkL6Od\/nlBa3n\/Pux1nMOvqilU16gc2\/rdbn7agET9uuHXtPNkV2YoRPbFGXdzdH68crLaPVsbzyF\/zSozcdKlM7rz4pmN3RiTzbCM7nXogrhlPqMVXLhIkxYkhyCpbYn3gMUUn7\/aMKdQm6s9FupJcJuxft91At2Qfn17YNuI\/MymyuovT7bS9OR3X3\/Lw==\u0022 height=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n \t\t\t\tThe last section is \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/threejsplayground.brangerbriz.com\/archive\/\u0022 target=\u0022\u201c_blank\u201d\u0022\u003Ethe Archive\u003C\/a\u003E.

More specifically, they wanted a project that would not only exhibit works by the local artists involved in what has come to be known as the \u201cChicago dirty new media\u201d scene, but also showcase this community\u2019s particular style which, though diverse, consists of a \u201cdirty\u201d, critical, DIY approach to new technologies.\r\n\t\t\t\u003C\/bb-p\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cbb-h2\u003EThe Concept\u003C\/bb-h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cbb-p\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\tA common theme among these artists is their creative use of desktops.

The MCA specifically invited us to conceive a project which would \u201cshow off the Chicago digital scene to (the) international visitors\u201d attending the MW conference being held in Chicago that year. More specifically, they wanted a project that would not only exhibit works by the local artists involved in what has come to be known as the \u201cChicago dirty new media\u201d scene, but also showcase this community\u2019s particular style which, though diverse, consists of a \u201cdirty\u201d, critical, DIY approach to new technologies.\r\n\t\t\t\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe Concept\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\tA common theme among these artists is their creative use of desktops.

We\u0027ve amassed a large dataset including messages written in over 50 different languages.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Csection class=\u0022media\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/cms.brangerbriz.com\/img\/assetsFile\/images\/671908bbb827e6d665cba67a06b43711\u0022\u003E\u003C\/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nOur dataset and software are both open source and we hope that researchers, cultural anthropologists, and curious netizens will find our work useful.
