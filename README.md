# Branger_Briz

### dev notes

this site makes use of our [BBElements](https://github.com/brangerbriz/BBElementssome) library to conform to our internal branding, this includes the following files:
- css/bb-animations.css
- css/bb-code-colors.css
- css/bb-fonts.css
- css/bb-styles.css
- js/BBElements.js

any changes that need to be made to these files should be made to [BBElements](https://github.com/brangerbriz/BBElementssome) first. (Note: we could consider making these a sub-module of this library, but it might involve edits to the directory structure)

any/all issues/updates should be added as an [issue](https://github.com/brangerbriz/www/issues)
